Hearthstone Card Data
=====================

A usable and accurate hearthstone data source.

* cards.json - An up to date list of card descriptions, scraped from ZAM and Curse sites.
* utilities.js - Some JS utitlies used for processing card data.

=====================

This is currently a work in progress, with many omissions in `cards.json` such as Minion type (Beast/Demon/etc), Flavor text, and Mechanic tags.
