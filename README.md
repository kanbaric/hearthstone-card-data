Hearthstone Card Data
=====================

A usable and accurate hearthstone data source.

* cards.json - An up to date list of card descriptions, scraped from ZAM and Curse sites.
* utilities.js - Some JS utitlies used for processing card data.

=====================

This is a work in progress.  `cards.json` Should currently be useable, but I intend to add more metadata to the list such as Mechanic tags (Card Draw, Summon, etc), and maybe Flavor Text, Artist, etc.
