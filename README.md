Hearthstone Card Data
=====================

A usable and accurate hearthstone data source.

* cards.json - An up to date list of card descriptions, currently scraped from ZAM's hearthhead site.
* utilities.js - Some JS utitlies used for processing card data.

=====================

This is a work in progress.  `cards.json` should currently be useable, but I intend to add more metadata to the list such as Mechanic tags (Card Draw, Summon, etc), and maybe Flavor Text, Artist name, etc.
